# EvolutionSim
Hello! Welcome to a small project of mine. This project is meant to allow me to learn and use the basics of Neural Networking.
Hopefully, this will result in a fully simulated ecosystem with AI creatures populating it.
## Goals
My goals for this project are to:
- [x] Create a Neural Network for creatures
- [ ] Make these creatire be able to learn how to accomplish tasks via evolution and/or learning
- [ ] Create multiple complex inputs for the network
- [ ] Add more creatures to complete to model competition or predator-prey relations
## Current Status
Right now, I am trying to make creatures be able to evolve to eat food in a efficeint manner.
**This is a _work in progesss_ so please be mindful of that :)**.
